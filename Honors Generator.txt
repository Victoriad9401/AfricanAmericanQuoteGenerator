Index.html file:
- This shows the title page, the bubble effects, and other title parts

Style.css file:
- This shows the color effects on the page (color, font, etc.)

Script.js file: 
- This shows the type of quote, book, and author while also being able to run it randomly
- This can be used to update new quote or delete them as well.
- All you would have is copy & paste this code to add a code before the last quote 
        {
            quote:"add quote ",
            author: "add author",
            book: " add book title "
        },   

- the last quote is the same form as this but it doesn't have a comma at the end (the last quote is the Nikki Giovanni quote)

How to run the code:
- To run the code for the index.html page then click on the play button on the left side to run the page
- (its called Run & debug button )
- or Click the run button above by the "Go" button
