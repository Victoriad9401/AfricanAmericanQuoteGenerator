This project was developed as an honors initiative to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly platform where students can quickly find and understand significant quotes from African American literature throughout the semester. The goal is to support students in their studies by offering direct access to the quotes, along with helpful context related to the author and their work. This allows students to connect the quotes with the book titles, and authors.
